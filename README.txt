Easy add feedback buttons and feedback forms to your website with the Mopinion.com Wordpress Plugin. Easy install, fast user insights. Mopinion is a leading user feedback collection and analysis tool.

== Description ==

Let's say that you want to capture user feedback on your Wordpress website. This Feedback Form plugin makes that easy and is completely free.

Simply go to Settings &rarr; Mopinion Feedback Form in your website admin dashboard, and activate the Mopinion feedback form on your website.

A feedback button will be visible on your website. With the feedback form you can capture suggestions, bugs and compliments, and collect visual feedback (screenshots) about individual page elements. All feedback collected will be available on your personal Mopinion account, at https://app.mopinion.com, or it can be emailed straight in to your email inbox. The feedback form is completely customisable, so easily add or change feedback questions, add your own design and logo, setup your own language and use pro-active and exit-intent triggers to decide where you want to show or hide your feedback form.

If you want to add the feedback form to specific  articles (post, page, custom post type), then you can use the deployment section within your Mopinion account: https://app.mopinion.com/survey/manage#tab_deployment_pane.
